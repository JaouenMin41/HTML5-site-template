		<p id="poem">
			I was angry with my friend: <br>
I told my wrath, my wrath did end. <br>
I was angry with my foe: <br>
I told it not, my wrath did grow. <br> <br>

And I watered it in fears, <br>
Night and morning with my tears;<br>
And I sunned it with smiles,<br>
And with soft deceitful wiles.<br><br>

And it grew both day and night,<br>
Till it bore an apple bright.<br> 
And my foe beheld it shine.<br>
And he knew that it was mine,<br><br>

And into my garden stole<br>
When the night had veiled the pole;<br>
In the morning glad I see<br>
My foe outstretched beneath the tree.<br><br>
