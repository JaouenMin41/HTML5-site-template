# HTML5-site-template
Repository of the HTML5 site template project.

The objective of this project is to create a polivalent HTML5 web site template, supporting CSS and later JavaScript, with several themes.
Every one can use the templates to create their site if they mention my twitter (@daniel_fkv) and this Github repository in the "index.html" page.
All kind of help is welcome to the project.
